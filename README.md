# Health Calculator with AI

## Overview

Welcome to the Health Calculator with AI, a collaborative project co-developed with the assistance of AI! The application is currently equipped with a Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator, allowing users to determine their BMI by entering their weight and height. This is the foundation of a broader vision to create a versatile health calculator with a diverse range of features and, potentially, integrated AI capabilities.
